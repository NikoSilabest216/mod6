# Image ML Model

This project utilizes the VGG-16 model for image classification. The dataset includes three classes: rock, paper, and scissor, each with more than 1000 instances.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image:**
   - Ensure your image is in either .jpg, .png, or .jpeg format.
   - Press the "Execute" button to initiate the prediction.

2. **How to Use:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/NikoSilabest216/mod6.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory.
     ```bash
     cd <repository-folder>
     ```
   - Install the required dependencies.
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Start the Flask application.
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```
   - Open your web browser and visit [http://127.0.0.1:2000](http://127.0.0.1:2000) to access the image prediction interface.

## Important Note

Make sure to follow the specified image formats (.jpg, .png, .jpeg) for successful predictions.
